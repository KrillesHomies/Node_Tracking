% Example of data from the INS sensor being tested
% The test Case is drawing a 30x30 square two times.
%
% The trajectory using the EKF implementation is plotted to show the results,
% Zero velocity update is present in each corner where the sensors stops for a few secounds
%
% This is very simple example dataset to test the filter
